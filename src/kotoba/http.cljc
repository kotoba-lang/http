(ns kotoba.http
  "Assembled from one repo per definition.

  This namespace holds no implementation. It re-exports the definitions
  that each live in their own repo, so a call site can require one name
  and a library can require only the definitions it actually uses.

  AN IMPLEMENTATION BUILT AGAINST kotoba.lang.http IS NOT ACCEPTED HERE.
  kotoba.lang.http still declares IHttp, and a protocol split into its own
  repo is a DIFFERENT protocol from the one the source namespace declares
  (ADR-2609091900). Measured 2026-09-09 on kotoba.lang.fs: a filesystem
  reified against the source protocol answers through the source namespace
  and fails through this one -- No implementation of method: :exists?.
  Build the implementation against the repo that declares the protocol here,
  or call through kotoba.lang.http.

  NOT re-exported here, on purpose: IHttp. A protocol's identity is what extend-type and reify dispatch on,
  and a copy would make an implementation silently extend nothing, so the
  protocol name stays in the one repo that declares it. Requiring that repo
  is a compile error away; a copy would not be.
