  protocol. Layer 3 (I/O) of the kotoba foundational stdlib.

  No HTTP client is baked in: a capability-confined cell cannot open a socket,
  so transport lives behind the IHttp protocol, host-injected (same seam as
  kotobase.store/IStore and fs/IFilesystem). The data model and parse-url are
  pure and portable.

  Zero third-party runtime deps; .cljc (JVM / SCI / CLJS / GraalVM / kotoba-WASM)."

  hands in `rawHeaders` partitioned into pairs. Both seq as [name value].

  Lower-cased, and a name that appears more than once keeps its FIRST value.
  Not a fresh design decision -- it is the contract call sites were written
  against, and ACME reads [\"replay-nonce\"] and [\"location\"] positionally.

  Measured 2026-09-09, which is why hosts must hand in pairs and not a
  platform's own header object: both `fetch`'s `Headers` and Node's
  `res.headers` collapse a repeated header by JOINING it -- \"first, second\"
  -- which is a third answer, neither the first value nor the list."
