  Like `kotoba.lang.http/IHttp` for outbound requests, server effects live
  behind capabilities the host supplies. Portable code owns the handler
  (request map → response map); binding sockets, WebSocket/SSE channels, and
  `run-server` are host responsibilities.

  `http-kit/http-kit` is on the classpath via the `:httpkit-host` alias."
