     `No such var: impl/ring-async-response` on every consumer that merely
     required it, taking murakumo's main CI down for ~36h. The shape an async
     Ring handler must return is a plain channel — `as-channel` is what
     creates one, and `send!` puts the response on it. Keep the name alive as
     a function so existing callers keep working, but build it from vars
     http-kit actually exports."
