# kotoba-lang/http

[![CI](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/http/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/http/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Layer 3 (I/O) of the kotoba foundational stdlib** — a request/response data
model plus a pure `parse-url`, with an `IHttp` **protocol** the host injects.
No HTTP client is baked in, so the same code runs on kotoba-WASM where the
transport must be a granted host capability. Zero third-party runtime deps;
every namespace is `.cljc` (JVM / SCI / ClojureScript / GraalVM / kotoba-WASM).
See
[`docs/adr/ADR-kotoba-lang-foundational-stdlib.md`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-kotoba-lang-foundational-stdlib.md).

## Why a protocol

A capability-confined cell cannot open a socket on its own. `http` splits: the
**data model** (`request`, `response`, header helpers, `parse-url`) is pure and
portable; the **transport** (`send`) lives behind `IHttp`, host-injected — same
seam as `kotobase.store/IStore` and `fs/IFilesystem`. A `mock-http` is provided
for tests.

## Current surface

`kotoba.lang.http`:

- `request` / `response` — data constructors
- `header` (case-insensitive get) / `set-header`
- `parse-url` — `{scheme host port path query}` from a URL string
- `IHttp` protocol: `send` (host-injected transport)
- `mock-http` — routing fn → response, for tests

`kotoba.lang.http.wire` (see [The wire layer](#the-wire-layer)):

- `serialize-request` / `parse-response` — RFC 9112 §3 and §4–§6
- `recv-init` / `recv-feed` / `recv-eof` — a resumable parser that does not
  care where the read boundaries fell
- `exchange` — one request/response over an injected byte transport
- `transport-http` — an `IHttp` over that transport

## The wire layer

`kotoba.lang.http.wire` is an HTTP/1.1 client (RFC 9112) over an **injected
byte transport**. It knows nothing about TLS, sockets or DNS: it is handed two
functions and speaks HTTP through them, so the same code runs on a plaintext
socket, on a TLS 1.3 record layer, or on a kotoba-WASM host capability, and
`http` acquires a dependency on none of them.

```clojure
(require '[kotoba.lang.http :as http]
         '[kotoba.lang.http.wire :as w])

;; a transport is two functions
{:write (fn [octets] [:ok (count octets)])          ; | [:error reason detail]
 :read  (fn []       [:ok octets])}                 ; | [:eof] | [:error reason detail]

(w/exchange transport (http/request :get "https://a.b/x"))
;=> [:ok {:http/status 200 :http/headers {...} :http/body [...]}]
;=> [:error :conflicting-content-length {:values ["5" "6"]}]

;; or as the IHttp the rest of this library already speaks
(http/send (w/transport-http transport) (http/request :get "https://a.b/x"))
```

Bytes are a vector of ints in `0..255` ("octets"), so nothing depends on a host
byte-array type; `->octets`, `utf8-encode` / `utf8-decode`, `latin1-encode` /
`latin1-decode` and `octets->hex` convert.

### Errors are values

Every fallible entry point returns `[:ok value]` or `[:error reason detail]`,
where `reason` is a keyword naming exactly one refusal and `detail` is a map.
Nothing here throws. `.kotoba` has no `try`/`catch`, so a thrown parse error
could never become a decision core; a returned one can. `IHttp/send` must
return a response map, so on failure it returns one with `:http/status 0` and
`:http/error` — never an exception.

### It refuses rather than normalises

An ambiguous frame is a request-smuggling primitive, not a formatting quirk.
Each refusal has its own reason, because a parser that refuses everything with
`:bad-response` tells a caller nothing:

| reason | what it refuses |
|---|---|
| `:content-length-with-transfer-encoding` | both framings in one message (RFC 9112 §6.1) |
| `:conflicting-content-length` | two `Content-Length` values that disagree |
| `:malformed-content-length` | a length that is not digits |
| `:invalid-chunk-size` | a chunk size that is not hex, or is padded with space |
| `:chunk-size-too-large` / `:too-many-chunks` | chunk framing over the ceiling |
| `:truncated-chunk-data` | a chunk that ran past what arrived |
| `:missing-last-chunk` | no final `0\r\n\r\n` |
| `:missing-chunk-crlf` | a chunk not followed by CRLF |
| `:header-missing-colon` | a field line with no colon |
| `:whitespace-before-colon` | space before the colon (RFC 9112 §5.1) |
| `:bare-lf-line-terminator` | a bare LF used as a line terminator |
| `:obs-fold` | an obsolete line fold |
| `:body-too-large` / `:line-too-long` / `:too-many-headers` | over a caller-supplied ceiling |
| `:unsupported-http-version` | anything that is not HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 |
| `:header-name-contains-control` / `:header-value-contains-control` | CR, LF or NUL in a request header — refused at construction, so it never reaches the wire |
| `:truncated-response-head` / `:truncated-body` / `:empty-response` | the peer closed mid-message |

Identical duplicate `Content-Length` values are **accepted** and collapse to one
(RFC 9112 §6.3 permits it, and refusing a server that merely repeats itself
would break real traffic). Only disagreement is a desync.

Every ceiling is caller-supplied via `:limits` — the caller decides how much
memory a stranger may spend. `w/default-limits` is a starting point, not a
policy.

### What a caller must not assume

- **No HTTP/2, no HTTP/3.** `HTTP/2` in a status line is refused, not
  downgraded. There is no ALPN here — that belongs to the transport.
- **No redirect following.** A 302 is returned as a 302.
- **No connection management**: no pooling, no keep-alive reuse, no pipelining.
  `exchange` is one request over one transport.
- **No cookies, no auth, no proxies, no `CONNECT`**, no `Expect: 100-continue`
  (interim responses are discarded, not answered).
- **No content decoding.** `Content-Encoding: gzip` is handed back as bytes;
  `Transfer-Encoding: gzip` is refused outright.
- **No timeouts and no retries.** Both belong to the transport, which is the
  only thing that can block.
- **The body is octets, not a string.** Decode it yourself — `latin1-decode` is
  lossless, `utf8-decode` is strict and returns a result.
- **Field values are decoded latin-1**, one octet per code unit, so nothing the
  sender sent is lost.

### Live proof

`scripts/live_fetch.clj` composes `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-tls` as the transport
with this client and fetches from `kotobase.net:443` under an SPKI pin:

```sh
clojure -M:live scripts/live_fetch.clj
```

org-ietf-tls is a **script-scope** dependency (the `:live` alias) and appears
nowhere in `:deps`. The entire coupling is `tls-transport`, twenty lines that
turn `tls.client/write!` and `read!` into a `{:write :read}` pair.

## Kotoba source authority

`src/kotoba/lang/exact_router.kotoba` owns a zero-capability exact-route table:
case-normalized method plus literal path maps to a handler keyword. It compiles
to restricted browser JS and typed browser Wasm, and is bounded to 31 routes.
Transport remains host-provided; dynamic paths and middleware will use a later
bounded route-plan ABI. The measured boundary is recorded in
`migration/exact-router-v1.edn`.

## Install

```clojure
io.github.kotoba-lang/http {:git/sha "<sha>"}
```

## Use

```clojure
(require '[kotoba.lang.http :as http])

(http/parse-url "https://a.b:8443/x?y=1")  ;=> {:scheme "https" :host "a.b" :port 8443 :path "/x" :query "y=1"}
(let [c (http/mock-http (fn [req] (http/response 200 {} "ok")))]
  (-> (http/send c (http/request :get "https://a.b/x")) :http/status)) ;=> 200
```

## Verify

```sh
clojure -M:test                                      # JVM
nbb --classpath src:test run-tests.cljs              # the same .cljc suite, second runtime
clojure -M:lint
clojure -M:live scripts/live_fetch.clj               # live, over TLS 1.3
```

The suite prints `EXECUTED <n> FLOOR <n>` and fails below the floor; the live
script prints `LIVE-CHECKS <n>` and exits 2 rather than reporting a pass when
nothing ran. A suite that measured nothing must not look like one that measured
and found no problem.
