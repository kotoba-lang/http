  "Offline, deterministic proof for the HTTP/1.1 wire layer.

  Two things are asserted throughout. First, that every refusal produces its
  OWN reason keyword -- a parser that refuses everything with :bad-response
  tells a caller nothing and cannot be acted on. Second, that the parse does
  not depend on how the bytes were chunked: `feed-one-byte-at-a-time` re-runs
  the positive cases a byte at a time and demands the identical value, which
  is where real parsers break."
