  "The :clj host seam must expose every var of org.httpkit.server that the
   rewire contract promises. Regression for two measured failures:

   - 719a210 def'd ring-async-response from impl — a var http-kit never
     shipped — so the namespace itself failed to load on every plain JVM
     (murakumo CI red ~36h, runs ..33359825251; fixed by #3).
   - murakumo relay_server also binds `http/as-channel` (the non-deprecated
     WebSocket channel binding); without an as-channel def on the seam the
     next consumer after #3 died at compile of its own file. The seam must
     carry the full server surface, not just what the first consumer used."
