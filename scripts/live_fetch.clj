;; A live composition: kotoba-lang/org-ietf-tls as the byte transport,
;; kotoba.lang.http.wire as the HTTP/1.1 client on top of it.
;;
;;   clojure -M:live scripts/live_fetch.clj
;;
;; org-ietf-tls is a SCRIPT-SCOPE dependency (the :live alias) and nothing
;; else. `http` itself must not depend on TLS: it is Layer 3 of the
;; foundational stdlib and the superproject enforces a layer DAG. The whole
;; of the coupling is `tls-transport` below -- twenty lines that turn
;; tls.client/write! and read! into the {:write :read} pair the wire layer
;; asks for. Anything else that can move bytes both ways would do as well,
;; which is the point.
;;
;; The provider is org-ietf-tls's SHIPPED `tls.provider.jvm`, passed straight
;; to `client/handshake` with no adaptation. Measured at org-ietf-tls b91d4a1:
;; `handshake` runs `tls.provider.vectors/adapt` on the raw provider itself, so
;; the byte-array/byte-vector conversion happens once at the seam rather than at
;; each call site. An earlier revision of this script carried a shim for that;
;; it is deleted, because a documented workaround that is no longer needed reads
;; as a live constraint to the next person.
;;
;; Exit 0 only if every check passed AND at least `check-floor` checks ran:
;; a run that measured nothing must not report success (root ADR-2608136000).
